JXRO is a digital utility token intended for use within the JAVURO platform. It is not considered legal tender, a security, equity share, bond, derivative, or investment product.  
Ownership of JXRO does not grant rights to dividends, profit-sharing, voting, or any claim on the platform’s assets or operations.

JXRO may be traded or exchanged on external platforms or marketplaces; however, such transactions occur outside the direct control of the project.  
The legal treatment and applicability of such trading may vary depending on regional laws and are the sole responsibility of the user.
