The JAVURO project progresses systematically according to a phased roadmap within achievable parameters, strategically connecting technical development, community building, Web3 functionality integration, and ecosystem expansion.

Q2 2025:
The JAVURO utility token JXRO has been developed through smart contract technology, with the comprehensive platform utility structure finalized. This period marks the beginning of systematic planning for technical documentation enhancement, MVP design planning, and ecosystem development strategies. Technical requirement definitions for digital hub and application architecture design have commenced.

Q3 2025:
The release of official technical documentation will transparently share the project's vision, design structure, and platform mechanics with the global community and partners. The application prototype undergoes comprehensive redesign, with user experience-focused interface improvements and Web3 functionality integration planning (including wallet connectivity and participation recognition systems) moving forward. The structuring of platform community interaction flows and initial contribution-based community models begins to take shape.

Q4 2025:
The initial user participation system will be released in beta form, experimentally implementing community contribution recognition structures and curation features. The contributor-centered content ecosystem planning becomes more visible, with the platform simultaneously conducting feature enhancements and UX refinements based on real user feedback. Feedback collection systems are designed concurrently, laying the groundwork for community input channels.

Q1 2026:
The initial version of the Web3-centered digital ecosystem system is implemented, with participation features, premium functionality, and on-chain feedback structures being applied sequentially. The application transitions to an official release version, strengthening user-centered interface stability and community-based operational structures. Additionally, pilot events for connecting online and offline communities are planned, initiating participatory brand experiences.

Q2 2026:
JAVURO enters a dedicated user base expansion strategy, with multi-language and multi-cultural UX design reflected in recommendation engine enhancements. User-generated content (UGC) features are introduced, with location registration, reviews, and video content being integrated with recognition structures for creative contribution activities. These content systems operate based on community autonomy and trust-based evaluation structures.

H2 2026 and Beyond:
The platform gradually evolves with enhanced community participation features. Token holders and community contributors can propose and provide input on key platform policies within the feedback structure, with community budget systems being introduced to expand from an operator-centered structure to a community-based participation framework. In the long term, the vision is for growth into a Web3 application with real-time recommendation and participation-based practical use features.

Roadmap Notice:
This development timeline may be flexibly adjusted according to internal implementation schedules and external environmental changes. The JAVURO team is committed to technical excellence and community trust, promising responsible implementation of each milestone.

                <p>
                  JAVURO was born from the value of spontaneous experiences and connections. While existing location-based 
                  apps focused solely on information provision, we introduced 'instant communication' and 'community-driven 
                  decision' systems to reflect users' desires for new experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The name "JAVURO" embodies our core philosophyâ€”combining spontaneous journey ('JA' from Journey) with 
                  innovative experience and connection ('X' representing the crossing point where users meet). Our name 
                  captures the essence of our platform: an instant journey (Journey) that connects (X-Connect) users 
                  through real-time, location-based experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through our futuristic and minimal design, powerful color combination of neon blue and coral orange, 
                  and logo design emphasizing 'X', we express the aesthetics of the Web3 era while reinforcing our 
                  mission of creating meaningful connections.
